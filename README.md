# Fake News Detection Using LSTM  

## Overview  
This project aims to detect fake news articles using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The model leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and embeddings to analyze and classify news articles as real or fake.  

## Features  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stemming, and removal of noise to clean the dataset.  
- **Word Embeddings**: Utilized Word2Vec/GloVe embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of text.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built with TensorFlow/Keras, using an LSTM network for sequential data processing.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed for integration into real-world applications such as APIs or user-facing systems.  

## Dataset  
The project uses a labeled dataset containing thousands of news articles. Each article is classified as either "real" or "fake." 

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK  
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
